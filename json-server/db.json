If you haven't written a single line of JS code so far and you're reading this text in a browser, on a desktop computer, it means that you are literally seconds away from your first JavaScript program.",
            "There are other ways to run JS code in the browser. For example, if we talk about the usual use of JavaScript programs, they are loaded into the browser to make web pages work. As a rule, the code is formatted as separate .js files that are connected to web pages, but program code can also be included directly in the page code. All this is done with the <script> tag. When the browser encounters such code, it executes it. For details on the script tag, see w3school.com. In particular, consider an example that demonstrates how to work with a web page using JavaScript, given on this resource. This example can also be run using this resource (look for the Try it Yourself button), but we will do it a little differently.
